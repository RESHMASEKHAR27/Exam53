# Exam53

Created a form with Name, Email, Hobbies (Multiple options selectable), Date of Birth(Calendar selection) and two submit buttons, from which the first button label will be "I am below 18" and the second "I am above 18". Click on the first button and submit the form to the "kids" method and use the other to "adult" if the age criteria match based on the Date of Birth using Dot Net MVC. Use JQuery/JS for front DOB Validation.
